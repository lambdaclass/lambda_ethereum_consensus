# Simple SerialiZe NIF implementation

## Adding a new type

In order to add a new SSZ container to the repo, we need to modify the NIF. Here's the how-to:

*Note that you can start from whichever side you are most comfortable with.*

Rust side (`native/ssz_nif`):

1. Look for the struct definition in the *[lighthouse_types](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/tree/stable/consensus/types)* crate (it should have the same name as in the [spec](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/tree/dev)).
2. Add the struct definition to the corresponding module under `native/ssz_nif/src/types`, surrounding it with `gen_struct` and adding the `#[derive(NifStruct)]` and `#[module …]` attributes (you can look at `beacon_chain.rs` for examples).
3. If the lighthouse struct uses generics, you’ll have to alias it in `native/ssz_nif/src/lh_types.rs`, and use that same name for your struct.
4. Translate the types used (`Epoch`, `[u64; 32]`, etc.) to ones that implement *rustler* traits (you can look at [this cheat sheet](https://rustler-web.onrender.com/docs/cheat-sheet), or at the already implemented containers). These types should be equivalent to the ones used in [the official spec](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/tree/dev).
5. If it fails because `FromElx` or `FromLH` are not implemented for types X and Y, add those implementations in `utils/from_elx.rs` and `utils/from_lh.rs` respectively.
6. Add the type name to the list in `to_ssz` and `from_ssz`.
7. Check that it compiles correctly.

Elixir side:

1. Add a new file and module with the container's name under `lib/ssz_types`. The module should be prefixed with `SszTypes.` (you can use an existing one as a template).
2. Add the struct definition and `t` type. You should try to mimic types used in the official spec, like those in `lib/ssz_types/mod.ex` (feel free to add any that are missing).
3. Add the implemented struct's name to the `@enabled` list in the `SSZStaticTestRunner` module (file `test/spec/runners/ssz_static.ex`).
4. Check that spec-tests pass, running `make spec-test`. For this, you should have all the project dependencies installed (this is explained in the main readme).

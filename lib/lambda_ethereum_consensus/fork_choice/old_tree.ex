  Fork tree. Nodes are represented as tuples. Usage:

  Tree.add_block(node)
  head = Tree.get_head()

  A node containing :root as a parent_id is considered a the root. When adding a block,
  the subtree_weight of all of its parents up until the root will be updated. At the same
  time, the head wil be recalculated using the greedy heaviest subtree strategy.

  When requesting the head, a cached value will be returned instantly, according to the last
  calculated one.

    A struct representing a tree node, with its id, the id from its parent and the ids from its

    It also contains its own self_weight due to attestations and proposer boost, and a
    subtree_weight, which is the sum of all of the weights of its successors. This value is calculated
    by the tree so manually assignment is not necessary.

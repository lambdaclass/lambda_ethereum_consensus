## Why Elixir?

Elixir is a functional programming language that runs atop the Erlang Virtual Machine (BEAM). It offers enhanced readability, syntactic sugar, and reduced boilerplate, enabling developers to achieve more with fewer lines of code compared to Erlang. Like Erlang, Elixir compiles to bytecode that is interpreted by the VM. As a result, it inherits several notable properties, including:

- Fault tolerance for increased reliability
- High availability
- Simplified construction of complex distributed systems
- Predictable latency

[Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) and its VM were originally developed in 1986 for telecommunication systems that demanded unparalleled uptime and reliability. We recognize that these attributes could be immensely beneficial for an Ethereum client, particularly in the realm of consensus. This is why our current focus is on building a consensus layer (CL) rather than an execution layer (EL). Elixir may not be tailored for sheer performance, but it excels in delivering predictable latency and creating systems designed for continuous operationâ€”qualities essential for the CL.

Our aim is to infuse these strengths into the Ethereum consensus client ecosystem with our offering.

We also have for objective to bootstart an Ethereum Elixir community, and to make Elixir a first-class citizen in the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Contributor Package

Dream of becoming an Ethereum core developer? Eager to shape the protocol that will underpin tomorrow's world? Want to collaborate with a passionate team, learn, grow, and be a pivotal part of the Ethereum Elixir community?

**Then you're in the right place! ðŸš€**

### Getting Started:

#### 1. **Installation**:

- **Prerequisites**: Before diving in, ensure you have the necessary tools installed. Check out the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section for guidance.
  
- **Clone the Repository**:

  ```shell
  git clone [REPO_URL]
  cd lambda-ethereum-consensus
  ```

- **Setup**: Once you've cloned the repository, follow the steps in the [Installing and running](#installing-and-running) section to set up your environment.

#### 2. **Prerequisite Knowledge**:

To contribute effectively, you'll need a foundational understanding of both the Ethereum protocol and the Elixir language, including the Erlang VM (BEAM). If you're new to these areas, we've curated a list of resources to get you started:

**Learning Elixir**:

- **Books**:

While some of the resources listed might appear outdated, it's important to understand that the Ethereum protocol is continuously evolving. As such, there isn't a definitive, unchanging source of information. However, these resources, even if older, provide foundational knowledge that remains pertinent to understanding the protocol's core concepts.

Truly mastering the Ethereum protocol is a complex endeavor. The list provided here is just a starting point, and delving deeper will necessitate exploring a broader range of readings and resources. As you immerse yourself in the project, continuous learning and adaptation will be key.

If you come across any resource that you find invaluable and believe should be added to this list, please don't hesitate to suggest its inclusion.

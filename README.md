[![Telegram chat](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftg.sumanjay.workers.dev%2Flambdaconsensus%2F&logo=telegram&label=chat&color=neon)](https://t.me/lambdaconsensus)

## Prerequisites

### Direct Installation

You can install the necessary components directly from official sources:

- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)
- [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/downloads)
- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Protoc](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/)

### Alternative (Recommended) Installation

For precise control over versions, it's recommended to use the **asdf** tool version manager and follow the versions specified in `.tool-versions` in this repository.

- [asdf tool version manager](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html)

After installing **asdf**, add the required plugins for managing the tools:

```shell
asdf plugin add elixir
asdf plugin add erlang
asdf plugin add golang
asdf plugin add rust
asdf plugin add protoc
```

Finally, install the specific versions of these tools as specified in `.tool-versions`:

```shell
asdf install
```

### Alternative (easier) Installation using Nix 
To create a sandbox environment with all the required tool chains, use Nix. Steps to get Nix working are as follows:

1. Install Nix from the official website: https://nixos.org/download.
2. To allow experimental features (nix develop and nix-command) you might need to do the following:

```shell
mkdir ~/.config/nix
echo "experimental-features = nix-command flakes " > ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
```

Alternatively, for a smoother experience you can use the following script from [Determinate Systems](https://zero-to-nix.com/start/install) that takes care of setting up everything for you:

```shell 
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

- Check if Nix has been successfully installed: `nix --version`.
- To launch the environment: `nix develop`.

## Installing and running

There are Makefile targets for these tasks.

> [!TIP]
> You can list the available targets with `make help`

```shell
make deps # Installs dependencies
make iex  # Runs a terminal with the application started
```

The iex terminal can be closed by pressing ctrl+c two times.

> [!WARNING]
> The node isn't capable of syncing from genesis yet, and so requires using checkpoint-sync to start (see [Checkpoint Sync](#checkpoint-sync)).
> In case checkpoint-sync is needed, `make iex` will end immediately with an error.

### Checkpoint Sync

You can also sync from a checkpoint given by a trusted third-party.
You can specify a URL to fetch it from with the "--checkpoint-sync-url" flag:

```shell
iex -S mix run -- --checkpoint-sync-url <your_url_here>
```

Some public endpoints can be found in [eth-clients.github.io/checkpoint-sync-endpoints](https://eth-clients.github.io/checkpoint-sync-endpoints/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The data retrieved from the URL is stored in the DB once the node is initiated (i.e. the iex prompt shows).
> Once this happens, following runs of `make iex` will start the node using that data.

### Beacon API

You can start the application with the Beacon API on the default port `4000` running:
```shell
make start
```

You can also specify a port with the "--beacon-api-port" flag:

```shell
iex -S mix run -- --beacon-api --beacon-api-port <your_port_here>
```
> [!WARNING]
> In case checkpoint-sync is needed, following the instructions above will end immediately with an error (see [Checkpoint Sync](#checkpoint-sync)).
>

### Tests, linting and formatting

Our CI runs tests, linters, and also checks formatting and typing.
To run these checks locally:

```shell
make test      # Runs tests
make spec-test # Runs all spec-tests
make lint      # Runs linter and format-checker
make dialyzer  # Runs type-checker
```

Source code can be formatted using `make fmt`.
This formats not only the Elixir code, but also the code under [`native/`](./native/).

### Docker

The repo includes a `Dockerfile` for the consensus client. It can be built with:

```bash
docker build -t consensus .
```

Then you run it with `docker run`, adding CLI flags as needed:

```bash
docker run consensus --checkpoint-sync <url> --network <network> ...
```

## Consensus spec tests

You can run all of them with:

```shell
make spec-test
```

Or only run those of a specific config with:

```shell
make spec-test-config-`config`

# Some examples
make spec-test-config-mainnet
make spec-test-config-minimal
make spec-test-config-general
```

Or by a single runner in all configs, with:

```shell
make spec-test-runner-`runner`

# Some examples
make spec-test-runner-ssz_static
make spec-test-runner-bls
make spec-test-runner-operations
```

The complete list of test runners can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/tree/dev/tests/formats).

If you want to specify both a config and a runner:

```shell
make spec-test-mainnet-operations
make spec-test-minimal-epoch_processing
make spec-test-general-bls
```

More advanced filtering (e.g. by fork or handler) will be re-added again, but if you want to only run a specific test, you can always do that manually with:

```shell
mix test --no-start test/generated/<config>/<fork>/<runner>.exs:<line_of_your_testcase>
```
You can put a "*" in any directory (e.g. config) you don't want to filter by, although that won't work if adding the line of the testcase.

> [!NOTE]
> We specify the `--no-start` flag to stop *ExUnit* from starting the application, to reduce resource consumption.

## Why Elixir?

Elixir is a functional programming language that runs atop the Erlang Virtual Machine (BEAM). It offers enhanced readability, syntactic sugar, and reduced boilerplate, enabling developers to achieve more with fewer lines of code compared to Erlang. Like Erlang, Elixir compiles to bytecode that is interpreted by the VM. As a result, it inherits several notable properties, including:

- Fault tolerance for increased reliability
- High availability
- Simplified construction of complex distributed systems
- Predictable latency

[Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) and its VM were originally developed in 1986 for telecommunication systems that demanded unparalleled uptime and reliability. We recognize that these attributes could be immensely beneficial for an Ethereum client, particularly in the realm of consensus. This is why our current focus is on building a consensus layer (CL) rather than an execution layer (EL). Elixir may not be tailored for sheer performance, but it excels in delivering predictable latency and creating systems designed for continuous operation—qualities essential for the CL.

Our aim is to infuse these strengths into the Ethereum consensus client ecosystem with our offering.

We also have for objective to bootstart an Ethereum Elixir community, and to make Elixir a first-class citizen in the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Metrics

When running the node, metrics are available at [`http://localhost:9568/metrics`](http://localhost:9568/metrics) in Prometheus format.

### Grafana

A docker-compose is available at [`metrics/`](./metrics) with a Grafana-Prometheus setup preloaded with dashboards that disponibilize the data.
To run it, install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and execute:

```shell
make grafana-up
```

After that, open [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/) in a browser.
The default username and password are both `admin`.

To stop the containers run `make grafana-down`. For cleaning up the metrics data, run `make grafana-clean`.

## Profiling

### QCachegrind

To install [QCachegrind](https://github.com/KDE/kcachegrind) via [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/qcachegrind), run:

```sh
brew install qcachegrind
```

To build a qcachegrind profile, run, inside iex:

```elixir
LambdaEthereumConsensus.Profile.build()
```

Options and details are in the `Profile` package. After the profile trace is generated, you open it in qcachegrind with:

```shell
qcachegrind callgrind.out.<trace_name>
```

If you want to group the traces by function instead of process, you can use the following before viewing it in qcachegrind:

```shell
grep -v "^ob=" callgrind.out.trace_name > callgrind.out.merged.trace_name
```

### etop

Another useful tool to quickly diagnose processes taking too much CPU is `:etop`, similar to UNIX `top` command. This is installed by default in erlang, and included in the `:observer` extra application in `mix.exs`. You can run it with:

```elixir
:etop.start()
```

In particular, the `reds` metric symbolizes `reductions`, which can roughly be interpreted as the number of calls a function got.
This can be used to identify infinite loops or busy waits.

Also of note is the `:sort` option, that allows sorting the list by, for example, message queue size:

```elixir
:etop.start(sort: :msg_q)
```

### eFlambè

When optimizing code, it might be useful to have a graphic way to determine bottlenecks in the system.
In that case, you can use [eFlambè](https://github.com/Stratus3D/eflambe) to generate flamegraphs of specific functions.
The following code will capture information from 10 calls to `Handlers.on_block/2`, dumping it in different files named \<timestamp\>-eflambe-output.bggg.

```elixir
:eflambe.capture({LambdaEthereumConsensus.ForkChoice.Handlers, :has_block?, 2}, 10)
```

The files generated can be processed via common flamegraph tools.
For example, using [Brendan Gregg's stack](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph):

```shell
cat *-eflambe-output.bggg | flamegraph.pl - > flamegraph.svg
```
